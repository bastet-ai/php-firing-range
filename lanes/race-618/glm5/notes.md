# GLM5-ToB lane notes (started 24-Oct)
- brief: lanes/race-618/GLM5-TOB-BRIEF.md
- host note: arm64 box; new-target matrix work only (:8102+); glm4 owns :8099.
- HOST MEM at dispatch: 108/119G used, 10G avail -> check free -g before each new container; vllm-fn + gitlab-vuln + QEMU VM are the big co-tenants; if <4G avail, ask orchestrator before tearing anything.
